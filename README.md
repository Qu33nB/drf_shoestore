Once upon a time, Joe was born in the African Savanna. 
He lived and learned from the wind and the trees. 
They taught him the secrets of django as a young child. 
He used this life knowledge to impart his genius on a percentage of the masses via Kenzie Academy.

P.S. Yes, he knew of django before it existed but was too cynical to believe these things were real until the language came into creation.
